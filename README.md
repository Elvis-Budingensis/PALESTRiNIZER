This is a command-line program that requires Java to run. The software searches for feature correlations and can either output ranked lists with statistics or generate visualizations of predefined features such as major chords, tone density, and texture density.
It is recommended to create shell scripts in order to analyze multiple works recursively.

The software was developed by Daniel Hensel and Ingo Jache for the Habilitation Project in Systematic Musicology at Martin Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany. Official Website:
